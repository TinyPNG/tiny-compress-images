## Information for plugin contributors

### Prerequisites
* A working Docker 1.12+ and Docker Compose installation (https://docs.docker.com/installation/).
* Composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/).
* Node LTS

### Running the plugin in WordPress
1. Run `bin/run-wordpress <wordpress version> <php version>`. E.g. `bin/run-wordpress 60 73`.
2. Connect to Wordpress on port `80<wordpress version>` (e.g. port `8060`).

### Running the unit tests
1. Run `bin/unit-tests <optional path to file>`.

### Running the integration tests
1. Install Docker 1.12 and docker-compose.
2. Install npm dependancies
3. Run `bin/integration-tests <wordpress version> <php version>`. E.g. `bin/integration-tests 60 80`.

### Check if the code follows WordPress standard
1. Run `bin/check-style` to make sure there are no errors.

### Test XML-RPC code
WordPress can either be used via the web interface or through the official
WordPress apps for mobile devices. WordPress uses XML-RPC internally to
communicate between the app and the WordPress admin. Make sure therefore
that when developing functionality that is linked to functionality available
in the mobile app that it also works over XML-RPC.

### Translating the plugin
Language packs will be generated for the plugin once translations for a
language are 100% filled in and approved.

See https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/tiny-compress-images.

For development you may create .po and .mo files for a each language. The .mo
files can be created with [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/).
Install gettext and generate the .mo language file do the following:

1. Install gettext for example run `brew install gettext`.
2. Add a link msgfmt `ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/gettext/0.19.7/bin/msgfmt ~/.bin`.
3. Generate the .mo files `bin/format-language-files`.

When finished modifying, you can upload the changes to the SVN trunk. Within
roughly 15 minutes WordPress will be updated and allow to add missing
translations before publishing the new plugin release.
